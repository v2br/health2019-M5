# ML enabled Pre-ICU Patient Warning System


## Summary
Using datasets from a group of healthy people and critically ill patients, we trained a machine learning model that can potentially provide advanced warning predicting the risks of a patient will reach admission criteria for intensive care unit (ICU).

Our system, once well trained, can potentially help clinical teams take preemptive actions before a patient's health status is deteriorating drastically. It can also help the clinical teams prepare the right treatments in advance.
